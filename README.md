_Get strong typed, autocompleted resources like images, fonts and segues in Swift projects_

## Why use this?

It makes your code that uses resources:
- **Fully typed**, less casting and guessing what a method will return
- **Compiletime checked**, no more incorrect strings that make your app crash at runtime
- **Autocompleted**, never have to guess that image name again

Currently you type:
```swift
let icon = UIImage(named: "settings-icon")
let font = UIFont(name: "San Francisco", size: 42)
performSegueWithIdentifier("openSettings")
```

With R.swift it becomes:
```swift
let icon = R.image.settingsIcon
let font = R.font.sanFrancisco(size: 42)
performSegueWithIdentifier(R.segue.openSettings)
```

## Features

After installing R.swift into your project you can use the `R`-struct to access resources. If the struct is outdated just build and R.swift will correct any missing/changed/added resources.

R.swift currently supports these types of resources:
- [Images](Documentation/Examples.md#images)
- [Storyboards](Documentation/Examples.md#storyboards)
- [Segues](Documentation/Examples.md#segues)
- [Nibs](Documentation/Examples.md#nibs)
- [Reusable cells](Documentation/Examples.md#reusable-cells)
- [Custom fonts](Documentation/Examples.md#custom-fonts)
- [Resource files](Documentation/Examples.md#resource-files)

Runtime validation with [`R.validate()`](Documentation/Examples.md#storyboards):
- If images used in storyboards are available
- If view controllers with storyboard identifiers can be loaded

## Installation

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is the recommended way of installation, as this avoids including any binary files into your project.

### CocoaPods (recommended)

_There is also a [short video](https://vimeo.com/122888912) of this instruction._

1. Add `pod 'R.swift'` to your [Podfile](http://cocoapods.org/#get_started) and run `pod install`
2. In XCode: Click on your project in the file list, choose your target under `TARGETS`, click the `Build Phases` tab and add a `New Run Script Phase` by clicking the little plus icon in the top left
3. Drag the new `Run Script` phase **above** the `Compile Sources` phase and **below** `Check Pods Manifest.lock`, expand it and paste the following script: `"$PODS_ROOT/R.swift/rswift" "$SRCROOT"`
4. Build your project, in Finder you will now see a `R.generated.swift` in the `$SRCROOT`-folder, drag the `R.generated.swift` files into your project and **uncheck** `Copy items if needed`

_Tip:_ Add the `*.generated.swift` pattern to your `.gitignore` file to prevent unnecessary conflicts.

### Manually

1. [Download](https://github.com/mac-cain13/R.swift/releases) a R.swift release, unzip it and put it into your source root directory
2. In XCode: Click on your project in the file list, choose your target under `TARGETS`, click the `Build Phases` tab and add a `New Run Script Phase` by clicking the little plus icon in the top left
3. Drag the new `Run Script` phase **above** the `Compile Sources` phase, expand it and paste the following script: `"$SRCROOT/rswift" "$SRCROOT"`
4. Build your project, in Finder you will now see a `R.generated.swift` in the `$SRCROOT`-folder, drag the `R.generated.swift` files into your project and **uncheck** `Copy items if needed`

_Tip:_ Add the `*.generated.swift` pattern to your `.gitignore` file to prevent unnecessary conflicts.

Please post any issues, questions and compliments in the GitHub issue tracker and feel free to submit pull request with fixes and improvements. Keep in mind; a good pull request is small, forked from the `develop`-branch and well explained. It also should benefit most of the users.
