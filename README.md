# R.swift [![Version](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/R.swift.svg?style=flat)](https://cocoapods.org/pods/R.swift) [![License](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/l/R.swift.svg?style=flat)](blob/master/License) ![Platform](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/p/R.swift.svg?style=flat)

_Get strong typed, autocompleted resources like images, fonts and segues in Swift projects_

## Why use this?

It makes your code that uses resources:
- **Fully typed**, less casting and guessing what a method will return
- **Compile time checked**, no more incorrect strings that make your app crash at runtime
- **Autocompleted**, never have to guess that image name again

Currently you type:
```swift
let icon = UIImage(named: "settings-icon")
let font = UIFont(name: "San Francisco", size: 42)
let color = UIColor(named: "indicator highlight")
let viewController = CustomViewController(nibName: "CustomView", bundle: nil)
let string = String(format: NSLocalizedString("welcome.withName", comment: ""), locale: NSLocale.current, "Arthur Dent")
```

With R.swift it becomes:
```swift
let icon = R.image.settingsIcon()
let font = R.font.sanFrancisco(size: 42)
let color = R.color.indicatorHighlight()
let viewController = CustomViewController(nib: R.nib.customView)
let string = R.string.localizable.welcomeWithName("Arthur Dent")
```

## CocoaHeadsNL presentation

Mathijs Kadijk presented R.swift at the September 2016 CocoaHeadsNL meetup.
Talking about the ideas behind R.swift and demonstrating how to move from plain stringly-typed iOS code to statically typed code.

## Features

After installing R.swift into your project you can use the `R`-struct to access resources. If the struct is outdated just build and R.swift will correct any missing/changed/added resources.

R.swift currently supports these types of resources:
- [Images](Documentation/Examples.md#images)
- [Fonts](Documentation/Examples.md#custom-fonts)
- [Resource files](Documentation/Examples.md#resource-files)
- [Colors](Documentation/Examples.md#colors)
- [Localized strings](Documentation/Examples.md#localized-strings)
- [Storyboards](Documentation/Examples.md#storyboards)
- [Segues](Documentation/Examples.md#segues)
- [Nibs](Documentation/Examples.md#nibs)
- [Reusable cells](Documentation/Examples.md#reusable-table-view-cells)

Runtime validation with [`R.validate()`](Documentation/Examples.md#runtime-validation):
- If all images used in storyboards and nibs are available
- If all named colors used in storyboards and nibs are available
- If all view controllers with storyboard identifiers can be loaded
- If all custom fonts can be loaded

## Installation

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is the recommended way of installation, as this avoids including any binary files into your project.

_Note on Carthage: R.swift is a tool used in a build step, it is not a dynamic library. Therefore [it is not possible](https://github.com/mac-cain13/R.swift/issues/42) to install it with Carthage._

### CocoaPods (recommended)

1. Add `pod 'R.swift'` to your [Podfile](http://cocoapods.org/#get_started) and run `pod install`
2. In Xcode: Click on your project in the file list, choose your target under `TARGETS`, click the `Build Phases` tab and add a `New Run Script Phase` by clicking the little plus icon in the top left
3. Drag the new `Run Script` phase **above** the `Compile Sources` phase and **below** `Check Pods Manifest.lock`, expand it and paste the following script:  
   ```
   "$PODS_ROOT/R.swift/rswift" generate "$SRCROOT/R.generated.swift"
   ```
4. Add `$TEMP_DIR/rswift-lastrun` to the "Input Files" and `$SRCROOT/R.generated.swift` to the "Output Files" of the Build Phase
5. Build your project, in Finder you will now see a `R.generated.swift` in the `$SRCROOT`-folder, drag the `R.generated.swift` files into your project and **uncheck** `Copy items if needed`

_Screenshot of the Build Phase can be found [here](Documentation/Images/BuildPhaseExample.png)_

_Tip:_ Add the `*.generated.swift` pattern to your `.gitignore` file to prevent unnecessary conflicts.

### [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/mint)

#### First, Install `R.Swift` Binary and Run Script Phase

1. Add `mac-cain13/R.swift` to your [Mintfile](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint#mintfile) and run `mint bootstrap`  to install this package without linking it globally (recommended)
2. In Xcode: Click on your project in the file list, choose your target under `TARGETS`, click the `Build Phases` tab and add a `New Run Script Phase` by clicking the little plus icon in the top left
3. Drag the new `Run Script` phase **above** the `Compile Sources` phase, expand it and paste the following script:  
   ```
   if mint list | grep -q 'R.swift'; then
     mint run R.swift rswift generate "$SRCROOT/R.generated.swift"
   else
     echo "error: R.swift not installed; run 'mint bootstrap' to install"
     return -1
   fi
   ```
4. Add `$TEMP_DIR/rswift-lastrun` to the "Input Files" and `$SRCROOT/R.generated.swift` to the "Output Files" of the Build Phase
5. Build your project, in Finder you will now see a `R.generated.swift` in the `$SRCROOT`-folder, drag the `R.generated.swift` files into your project and **uncheck** `Copy items if needed`

_Tip:_ Add the `*.generated.swift` pattern to your `.gitignore` file to prevent unnecessary conflicts.

#### Second, Install `R.Swift.Library` via the Swift Package Manager (requires Xcode 11)

If you see a build error `No such module 'Rswift'` when trying to `#import Rswift` at the top of the `R.generated.swift` file, then you will also need to install the *library* via the Swift Package Manager available in Xcode 11+.

Head over to the [R.Swift.Library](https://github.com/mac-cain13/R.swift.Library) repo and follow the [Swift Package Manager installation instructions](https://github.com/mac-cain13/R.swift.Library#swift-package-manager-requires-xcode-11).

### [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)

R.swift is also available through [Homebrew](http://brew.sh). This makes it possible to install R.swift globally on your system. Install R.swift by running: `brew install rswift`. The Homebrew formula is maintained by [@tomasharkema](https://github.com/tomasharkema).

### Manually

0. Add the [R.swift.Library](https://github.com/mac-cain13/R.swift.Library#Installation) to your project
1. [Download](https://github.com/mac-cain13/R.swift/releases) a R.swift release, unzip it and put it into your source root directory
2. In Xcode: Click on your project in the file list, choose your target under `TARGETS`, click the `Build Phases` tab and add a `New Run Script Phase` by clicking the little plus icon in the top left
3. Drag the new `Run Script` phase **above** the `Compile Sources` phase, expand it and paste the following script:  
   ```
   "$SRCROOT/rswift" generate "$SRCROOT/R.generated.swift"
   ```
4. Add `$TEMP_DIR/rswift-lastrun` to the "Input Files" and `$SRCROOT/R.generated.swift` to the "Output Files" of the Build Phase
5. Build your project, in Finder you will now see a `R.generated.swift` in the `$SRCROOT`-folder, drag the `R.generated.swift` files into your project and **uncheck** `Copy items if needed`

_Screenshot of the Build Phase can be found [here](Documentation/Images/ManualBuildPhaseExample.png)_

_Tip:_ Add the `*.generated.swift` pattern to your `.gitignore` file to prevent unnecessary conflicts.

### Building from source

R.swift is built using [Swift Package Manager (SPM)](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager).

1. Check out the code
2. Run `swift build -c release` from the root directory
3. Follow the manual installation steps with the binary you now have

For developing on R.swift in Xcode, run `swift package generate-xcodeproj --xcconfig-overrides RswiftConfig.xcconfig`.
