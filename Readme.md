_Get strong typed, autocompleted resources like images, fonts and segues in Swift projects_

## Why use this?

It makes your code that uses resources:
- **Fully typed**, less casting and guessing what a method will return
- **Compile time checked**, no more incorrect strings that make your app crash at runtime
- **Autocompleted**, never have to guess that image name again

Currently you type:
```swift
let icon = UIImage(named: "settings-icon")
let font = UIFont(name: "San Francisco", size: 42)
let viewController = CustomViewController(nibName: "CustomView", bundle: nil)
```

With R.swift it becomes:
```swift
let icon = R.image.settingsIcon()
let font = R.font.sanFrancisco(size: 42)
let viewController = CustomViewController(nib: R.nib.customView)
```

## Features

After installing R.swift into your project you can use the `R`-struct to access resources. If the struct is outdated just build and R.swift will correct any missing/changed/added resources.

R.swift currently supports these types of resources:
- [Images](Documentation/Examples.md#images)
- [Custom fonts](Documentation/Examples.md#custom-fonts)
- [Resource files](Documentation/Examples.md#resource-files)
- [Colors](Documentation/Examples.md#colors)
- [Localized strings](Documentation/Examples.md#localized-strings)
- [Storyboards](Documentation/Examples.md#storyboards)
- [Segues](Documentation/Examples.md#segues)
- [Nibs](Documentation/Examples.md#nibs)
- [Reusable cells](Documentation/Examples.md#reusable-cells)

Runtime validation with [`R.assertValid()`](Documentation/Examples.md#runtime-validation):
- If all images used in storyboards are available
- If all view controllers with storyboard identifiers can be loaded

## Installation

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is the recommended way of installation, as this avoids including any binary files into your project.

### CocoaPods (recommended)

_There is also a [short video](https://vimeo.com/122888912) of this instruction._

1. Add `pod 'R.swift'` to your [Podfile](http://cocoapods.org/#get_started) and run `pod install`
2. In XCode: Click on your project in the file list, choose your target under `TARGETS`, click the `Build Phases` tab and add a `New Run Script Phase` by clicking the little plus icon in the top left
3. Drag the new `Run Script` phase **above** the `Compile Sources` phase and **below** `Check Pods Manifest.lock`, expand it and paste the following script: `"$PODS_ROOT/R.swift/rswift" "$SRCROOT"`
4. Build your project, in Finder you will now see a `R.generated.swift` in the `$SRCROOT`-folder, drag the `R.generated.swift` files into your project and **uncheck** `Copy items if needed`

_Tip:_ Add the `*.generated.swift` pattern to your `.gitignore` file to prevent unnecessary conflicts.

### Manually

0. Add the [R.swift.Library](https://github.com/mac-cain13/R.swift.Library#Installation) to your project
1. [Download](https://github.com/mac-cain13/R.swift/releases) a R.swift release, unzip it and put it into your source root directory
2. In XCode: Click on your project in the file list, choose your target under `TARGETS`, click the `Build Phases` tab and add a `New Run Script Phase` by clicking the little plus icon in the top left
3. Drag the new `Run Script` phase **above** the `Compile Sources` phase, expand it and paste the following script: `"$SRCROOT/rswift" "$SRCROOT"`
4. Build your project, in Finder you will now see a `R.generated.swift` in the `$SRCROOT`-folder, drag the `R.generated.swift` files into your project and **uncheck** `Copy items if needed`

_Tip:_ Add the `*.generated.swift` pattern to your `.gitignore` file to prevent unnecessary conflicts.

### Homebrew (Unofficial)

R.swift is also available through [Homebrew](http://brew.sh). This makes it possible to install R.swift globally on your system. Install R.swift by running: `brew install rswift`. The Homebrew formula is maintained by [@tomasharkema](https://github.com/tomasharkema).
